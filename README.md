### **Overview**

A single-threaded, non-blocking web server written in C++, replicating core features of Nginx

---

### **Key Learnings**
- Low-level socket programming in C++
- Deep understanding of HTTP protocol (request/response format)
- Single-threaded multiplexing using poll()
- Applying object-oriented design to manage client-server logic

---

### **About**

üëâ [**Project requirement**](https://github.com/Mecha-Coder/42-webserv/blob/main/demo/en.subject.pdf)

‚ÄúNon-blocking‚Äù means the server does not wait for one task to finish before handling another. Tasks are executed asynchronously, allowing multiple connections to be managed at once. This is achieved through I/O multiplexing. In our implementation, we use poll() as the multiplexer.

Poll() is what makes our server responsive even with thousands of request coming in with just a single thread. We provide poll() with a list of sockets we want it to monitor, which I call the watchlist. poll() then tells us which sockets are ready to read or write (task)

![figure-1](https://github.com/Mecha-Coder/42-webserv/blob/main/demo/figure.png)

Here‚Äôs the general flow of our web server:

**1. New client connection**
   - When a client connects, the server creates a dedicated socket for that client ‚Äî think of it as the client‚Äôs mailbox. The client sends its HTTP request through this mailbox.

**2. Handling incoming request**

When the client‚Äôs mailbox has data ready to read, poll() triggers the Client Manager, which:
   - Parses and validates the HTTP request
   - Processes the request to determine how to respond
   - Fetches the required data from the Server Manager to prepare the response

**3. Sending the response**
   - Once the response is ready, the server sends it back to the client through the same socket.

If an error occurs during request handling, the server responds appropriately with a 4XX or 5XX HTTP status code.

### **Server Feature**
- Supports GET, POST, and DELETE methods
- File uploading and viewing
- Directory listing support
- Custom and default 400 and 500 error pages
- Redirects handling
- Virtual Hosting ‚Äî host multiple domains on the same IP:port
- Supports multiple sub-servers
- Implements CGI (Common Gateway Interface) ‚Äî offload tasks to external programs
- Basic cookie and session management
